= retriable

Stupid gem to retry code that may generate exceptions:

    retriable do
      puts 'You will see this'
      raise 'And this will trigger the retry'
    end

As a bonus feature, you can also specify how many times do you want it to retry:

    retriable(5) do
      #some extremely unreliable or painful code
    end
